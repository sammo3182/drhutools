  abstract = {This book is about generalized linear models as described by NeIder and Wedderburn (1972). This approach provides a unified theoretical and computational framework for the most commonly used statistical methods: regression, analysis of variance and covariance, logistic regression, log-linear models for contingency tables and several more specialized techniques. More advanced expositions of the subject are given by McCullagh and NeIder (1983) and Andersen (1980). The emphasis is on the use of statistical models to investigate substantive questions rather than to produce mathematical descriptions of the data. Therefore parameter estimation and hypothesis testing are stressed. I have assumed that the reader is familiar with the most commonly used statistical concepts and methods and has some basic knowledge of calculus and matrix algebra. Short numerical examples are used to illustrate the main points. In writing this book I have been helped greatly by the comments and criticism of my students and colleagues, especially Anne Young. However, the choice of material, and the obscurities and errors are my responsibility and I apologize to the reader for any irritation caused by them. For typing the manuscript under difficult conditions I am grateful to Anne McKim, Jan Garnsey, Cath Claydon and Julie Latimer.},

  abstract = {The importance of intellectual talent to achievement in all professional domains is well established, but less is known about other individual differences that predict success. The authors tested the importance of 1 noncognitive trait: grit. Defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, grit accounted for an average of 4\% of the variance in success outcomes, including educational attainment among 2 samples of adults (N=1,545 and N=690), grade point average among Ivy League undergraduates (N=138), retention in 2 classes of United States Military Academy, West Point, cadets (N=1,218 and N=1,308), and ranking in the National Spelling Bee (N=175). Grit did not relate positively to IQ but was highly correlated with Big Five Conscientiousness. Grit nonetheless demonstrated incremental predictive validity of success measures over and beyond IQ and conscientiousness. Collectively, these findings suggest that the achievement of difficult goals entails not only talent but also the sustained and focused application of talent over time.

  abstract = {In this article, we introduce brief self-report and informant-report versions of the Grit Scale, which measures trait-level perseverance and passion for long-term goals. The Short Grit Scale (Grit--S) retains the 2-factor structure of the original Grit Scale (Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, \& Kelly, 2007) with 4 fewer items and improved psychometric properties. We present evidence for the Grit--S's internal consistency, test--retest stability, consensual validity with informant-report versions, and predictive validity. Among adults, the Grit--S was associated with educational attainment and fewer career changes. Among adolescents, the Grit--S longitudinally predicted GPA and, inversely, hours watching television. Among cadets at the United States Military Academy, West Point, the Grit--S predicted retention. Among Scripps National Spelling Bee competitors, the Grit--S predicted final round attained, a relationship mediated by lifetime spelling practice.}

  abstract = {Individual differences in proneness to shame and proneness to guilt are thought to play an important role in the development of both adaptive and maladaptive interpersonal and intrapersonal processes. But little empirical research has addressed these issues, largely because no reliable, valid measure has been available to researchers interested in differentiating proneness to shame from proneness to guilt. The Self-Conscious Affect and Attribution Inventory (SCAAI) was developed to assess characteristic affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses associated with shame and guilt among a young adult population. The SCAAI also includes indices of externalization of cause or blame, detachment/unconcern, pride in self, and pride in behavior. Data from 3 independent studies of college students and 1 study of noncollege adults provide support for the reliability of the main SCAAI subscales. Moreover, the pattern of relations among the SCAAI subscales and the relation of SCAAI subscales to 2 extant measures of shame and guilt support the validity of this new measure. The SCAAI appears to provide related but functionally distinct indices of proneness to shame and guilt in a way that these previous measures have not.

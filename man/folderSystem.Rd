\description{
Folder hierarchy creator for academic research
}
\details{
The function constructs a standardized folder hierarchy encompassing \verb{codes/}, \verb{data/}, \verb{output/}, \verb{paper/}, and \verb{document/}. These directories are designated for storing programming scripts, data sets, processed outputs, manuscript drafts (including related images and submission documents), and assorted materials, respectively. This organization facilitates easy retrieval of project components, ensuring that members of Dr. Hu's Amazing Team can efficiently navigate and manage shared resources. This structure is advocated for collaborative projects to maintain uniformity across team operations.
